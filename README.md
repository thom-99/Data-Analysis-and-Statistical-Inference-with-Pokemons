I grew up playing pokemons games on my nintendo for hours every day and I always had the impression that water type pokemons had significantly more HP than other pokemons. 
I decided to employ some data analysis and some statistical inference to finally get an answer! The project is thought as an wasy way to learn some pandas and apply some notions of statistical inference to something fun. 
The only prerequisites consists in a basic understanding of hypotesis testing and the patience to read in pandas documentation the functions you do not know. 

Feel free to use the dataset to create something fun on your own!!!
